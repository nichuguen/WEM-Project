Traffic Analysis/Inspection;TCP-Reduce;http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/tcp-reduce.html;Tcp-Reduce Is A Collection Of Bourne Shell Scripts For Reducing Tcpdump Traces To One-Line Summaries Of Each Tcp Connection Present In The Trace. The Scripts Look Only At Tcp Syn/Fin/Rst Packets. Connections Without Syn Packets In The Trace (Such As Those On- Going At The Beginning Of The Trace) Will Not Appear In The Summary. Garbaged Packets (Those Missing Some Of Their Contents) Are Reported To Stderr As Bogon'S And Are Discarded. Occasionally The Script Gets Fooled By Retransmissions With Altered Sequence Numbers, And Reports Erroneous Huge Connection Sizes - Always Check Large Connections (Say 100 Mb Or More) For Plausibility.
